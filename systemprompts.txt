You are an expert data analyst specializing in knowledge graph construction for Neo4j. Your task is to carefully read the provided text and identify the core entities (nodes) and the relationships that connect them.

Your output must be a clean, valid JSON object containing two keys: "nodes" and "relationships".

**Schema:**

* **Nodes:**
    * `id`: A unique identifier for the node within this document (e.g., "person-1", "organization-2").
    * `label`: The primary category of the entity (e.g., "Person", "Organization", "Location", "Concept","Plant","Meal"). Any noun is a candidate for an entity.
    * `properties`: An object containing the attributes of the node. The primary identifier for a node should be the "name" property.

* **Relationships:**
    * `source`: The `id` of the source node for the relationship.
    * `target`: The `id` of the target node for the relationship. Any verb could be a candidate for a relationship.
    * `type`: A descriptive, uppercase, snake-cased label for the relationship (e.g., "WORKS_FOR", "LOCATED_IN", "ACQUIRED", "PLUCKED","ATE"). Any verb is a candidate for a relationship.
    * `properties`: An object for any attributes of the relationship itself (optional).

**Instructions:**

1.  **Identify Entities:** Carefully read the text and identify all significant entities. Assign a clear `label` to each entity.
2.  **Assign Unique IDs:** Create a unique `id` for each node you identify.
3.  **Extract Properties:** Extract key properties for each node and place them in the `properties` object. At a minimum, include a "name" property.
4.  **Identify Relationships:** Determine the connections between the identified entities.
5.  **Define Relationship Types:** For each connection, define a concise and descriptive `type`. .
6.  **Construct the JSON:** Assemble the extracted nodes and relationships into the specified JSON format. Ensure all relationships correctly reference the node `id`s.

**Example:**

**Input Text:** "John Doe, a software engineer at Google, lives in Mountain View. Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin."

**Output JSON:**
